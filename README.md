## Quick Start (5 Minutes)
Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [ ] **Microsoft corporate VPN** connected
- [ ] **Microsoft corp account** (e.g., `your-alias@microsoft.com`) for Azure CLI sign-in
- [ ] **Personal GitHub account** (NOT your `_microsoft` EMU account) for GitHub Packages auth
- [ ] **GitHub Copilot License** — [Get one here (Microsoft Internal)](https://aka.ms/copilot)

---

### Step 0: Run The Installer

The one-liner below downloads the repo, verifies prerequisites, installs missing tools (Node.js, Azure CLI, GitHub CLI, VS Code, Obsidian, Copilot CLI), and walks you through Azure + GitHub sign-in. The whole flow takes about 5 minutes.

Installer behavior at a glance:

- **Default install directory:** `~/L.C.G` (your home folder). Press Enter at the prompt to accept, or type any path.
- **Cloud-synced paths are blocked:** OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive, and iCloud locations are rejected so local secrets never sync to the cloud.
- **Existing folder:** an empty folder is reused; a non-empty folder requires `-Force` and will be replaced.
- **Execution policy:** set to `Bypass` for the installer process only (no machine-wide change).

#### macOS / Linux

1. Open **Terminal** (Spotlight → search "Terminal").
2. Paste this and press **Enter**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JinLee794/L.C.G/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

#### Windows

1. Open **Windows PowerShell** — Start → type "PowerShell" → click **Windows PowerShell** (not Command Prompt, not PowerShell ISE).

   ![Open Windows PowerShell from Start](image/README/install-01-powershell.jpg)

2. Paste this one-liner and press **Enter**:

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass -Force; irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JinLee794/L.C.G/main/scripts/install.ps1?nocache=$(Get-Date -UFormat %s)" | iex
   ```

---

### What you'll be asked during the install

The installer is interactive — it will stop and ask you a few things. Here's exactly what to do at each prompt.

#### 1. Install directory

Accept the default (`C:\Users\<you>\L.C.G` on Windows, `~/L.C.G` on macOS/Linux) by pressing **Enter**, or type a different path. Anything inside OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive, or iCloud is rejected by design.

![Install directory prompt — press Enter for default](image/README/install-03-install-dir.jpg)

#### 2. Risk acknowledgement

Before any MCP servers are configured, the installer shows a security notice. Read it, then type **`yes`** and press **Enter** to continue. Typing anything else cancels the install.

![Risk acknowledgement — type yes](image/README/install-04-risk-ack.jpg)

#### 3. Azure sign-in (`az login`)

When prompted **`Run 'az login' now? [Y/n]:`**, press **Enter** (or type `Y`). A browser window pops up — **pick your Microsoft work account** (e.g. `alias@microsoft.com`) and click **Continue**.

![az login — choose your Microsoft work account](image/README/install-05-az-login.jpg)

If your tenant shows a subscription picker in the terminal, press **Enter** to accept the default.

#### 4. GitHub Packages auth — **use your personal GitHub account**

This is the single most important step. Private MCP packages (`@microsoft/msx-mcp-server`, `@jinlee794/obsidian-intelligence-layer`) are hosted on GitHub Packages, which requires a GitHub sign-in with `read:packages`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Sign in with your **personal GitHub account** (e.g. `JohnDoe`). **Do NOT** use your Enterprise Managed User account ending in `_microsoft`.

- At the **preferred protocol** prompt, select **HTTPS** (default).
- At **Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials?**, press **Enter** for `Yes`.

![GitHub Packages auth — personal account required](image/README/install-06-gh-personal-warning.jpg)

The installer prints a one-time code (e.g. `F7A5-ADE0`) and then opens `https://github.com/login/device` in your browser. Copy the code, switch to the browser, and paste it.

![Copy the one-time device code](image/README/install-07-gh-device-code.jpg)

Sign in on github.com with your **personal** account — if your browser auto-fills the `_microsoft` EMU account, click **Use a different account** first.

![Sign in with personal GitHub account](image/README/install-08-gh-signin.jpg)

Finally, click **Authorize github** to grant the device the `read:packages` scope.

![Authorize the device](image/README/install-09-gh-authorize.jpg)

Return to the terminal. The installer scaffolds your local vault, links the global `lcg` command, and prints `✔ Bootstrap complete.`

---

### Step 1: Start Using L.C.G.

When the installer finishes, everything is ready to go. Pick either path:

**VS Code (recommended):**

Open VS Code in your install folder (`code ~/L.C.G` or just double-click the folder in VS Code) → open **Copilot Chat** (`⌃⌘I` on macOS / `Ctrl+Alt+I` on Windows) → select the **Chief of Staff** agent → start typing.

**Terminal:**

Open any terminal, anywhere, and type `lcg`. A new `copilot` session launches with all L.C.G. servers, agents, and skills loaded.

> Both interfaces are fully equivalent — same agents, skills, and MCP servers. See [Two Ways to Use L.C.G.](#two-ways-to-use-lcg) for details.

---

### Step 2: Personalize It (Optional, 5 Minutes)

Defaults are fine for day one. When you want L.C.G. to match *your* role, VIPs, and cadence, run the onboarding wizard.

In VS Code → **Copilot Chat** → **Chief of Staff** agent → type:

```
/onboarding
```

The wizard asks about your:

1. **Role** — GM, CSAM, Specialist, or M1 Manager
2. **Industry** — Segment you cover (scopes CRM + Power BI queries)
3. **Team** — By territory, seller list, org hierarchy, or just you
4. **Forecast targets** — Optional quota and coverage multiple
5. **VIP list** — High-priority senders
6. **Operating rhythm** — Default weekly cadences

Answers are saved in your vault under `_lcg/` as plain markdown. Re-run `/onboarding` anytime, or edit the files directly.

---

<details>
<summary><strong>What the installer actually did (click to expand)</strong></summary>

The installer and bootstrap are designed to finish unattended. For the curious, here's everything that happened:

1. **Downloaded** the repo to your install directory (default: `~/L.C.G`).
2. **Verified prerequisites** — Node.js 18+, npm, git.
3. **Installed missing tools automatically** (Windows via `winget` / Chocolatey; macOS via Homebrew):
   - **Azure CLI** (`az`) — for corp auth against CRM and M365.
   - **GitHub Copilot CLI** — the official `@github/copilot` npm package, which provides the `copilot` binary used by `lcg`. A `gh copilot` extension is configured as a fallback.
   - **Obsidian Desktop** — for editing your vault in a nice UI.
4. **Prompted for `az login`** — sign in as `alias@microsoft.com`.
5. **Ran `npm install`** for repo dependencies.
6. **Walked through GitHub Packages auth** — uses your personal GitHub account (not your `_microsoft` EMU account).
7. **Created a local vault** at `.vault/` inside the install folder and seeded it with starter templates under `_lcg/`.
8. **Registered the global `lcg` command** using a `.cmd` shim on Windows so it works in restricted-policy PowerShell.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When prompted for GitHub auth, use your **personal GitHub account** (e.g., `JohnDoe`), not your Enterprise Managed User account ending in `_microsoft`.

> [!TIP]
> Run `./scripts/bootstrap.sh --check` (macOS/Linux) or `./scripts/bootstrap.ps1 -Check` (Windows) for a dry prerequisite check at any time.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Use a different Obsidian vault (click to expand)</strong></summary>

The installer creates a local vault inside your install folder (`.vault/`). If you already have an Obsidian vault elsewhere and want L.C.G. to use that instead:

1. Open `.env` in your install folder.
2. Set the path:

```dotenv
OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH="/Path/To/Your/Obsidian/Vault"
```

3. Seed it with L.C.G. starter templates (safe — never overwrites existing files):

```bash
npm run vault:init
```

This adds the following under your vault, without touching any of your existing notes:

| Added | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `_lcg/preferences.md` | Triage labels, display preferences |
| `_lcg/vip-list.md` | VIP senders that get priority in triage |
| `_lcg/operating-rhythm.md` | Weekly cadences (triage time, review days) |
| `_lcg/communication-style.md` | Tone guidance for drafted emails |
| `_lcg/learning-log.md` | Corrections L.C.G. remembers across sessions |
| `_lcg/templates/` | Meeting briefs, update requests, weekly summaries |
| `Daily/`, `Meetings/`, `Weekly/` | Working output folders |

> `.env` is git-ignored. Your paths and secrets stay local.

</details>

## Why L.C.G. Exists

You already know the pain:

- **Hundreds of emails** — and you're manually deciding what matters before your first coffee
- **Back-to-back meetings** — prep means hunting across 5+ tools you didn't build and don't love
- **Same deliverables, every week** — rebuilt from scratch instead of compounding
- **Institutional memory** — trapped in your head, not in a system
- **Follow-ups everywhere** — scattered across email, CRM, Teams, and sticky notes

No single tool today reads across your M365 + CRM stack, remembers *your* priorities, and still lets you own every final call. So you grind. Every. Single. Day.

L.C.G. turns GitHub Copilot into the tireless junior staffer you always wanted — one that **pre-reads, pre-researches, and pre-drafts everything** so you can focus on judgment, relationships, and the work that actually needs a human.

## How It Works (in plain English)

L.C.G. runs on three simple layers. You only ever interact with the first one.

```mermaid

  U["👤 YOU — type what you want in plain English"] --> L1

  subgraph L1["🧠 1. Instructions — how L.C.G. thinks"]
    direction LR
    I1["Your preferences"] --- I2["VIP list"] --- I3["Operating rhythm"] --- I4["Skills library"]
  end

    direction LR

  end

  style L3 fill:#3a0ca3,stroke:#c77dff,color:#e0e0e0
```

| Layer | What it means for you |
| --- | --- |
| **1. Instructions** | Your style, your VIPs, your priorities — written in plain markdown. Edit anytime. |
| **2. Live Data** | One request, many systems read at once. No more tab-hopping. |
| **3. Second Brain** | L.C.G. remembers your customers, deals, and corrections. **It gets smarter every week.** |

### Two Agents — One Brain, One Set of Hands

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  U["👤 YOU"] --> B

  subgraph B["🧠 Chief of Staff — the brain"]
    B1["Thinks, triages, drafts, recommends"]
  end

  B -- "delegates safely" --> H

  subgraph H["🤖 M365-Actions — the hands"]
    H1["Sends drafts, creates meetings, posts to Teams"]
  end

  style U fill:#0d1117,stroke:#58a6ff,color:#e6edf3
  style B fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#4cc9f0,stroke-width:2px,color:#e0e0e0
  style H fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#f72585,stroke-width:2px,color:#e0e0e0
```

The **brain** does all the thinking and never touches your inbox or Teams directly. The **hands** only act on scoped, approved instructions. If the brain wants to send a message, it hands off a draft — you approve before it leaves.

## You Stay in Control

Copilot grinds, but **nothing ships without you**.

| What L.C.G. does | What it won't do |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ **Drafts emails** in your voice | ❌ Never sends email without your review |
| ✅ **Prepares Teams messages** | ❌ Never posts without explicit approval |
| ✅ **Stages CRM updates** for review | ❌ Never writes to CRM silently |
| ✅ **Reads your vault** for context | ❌ Never syncs vault data to the cloud |
| ✅ **Logs every action** it takes | ❌ No surprise automation — ever |

> **Your data stays local.** Your vault lives on your machine. Your CRM credentials never leave your session. No external training. No "cloud memory." Just you and Copilot.

---

## What's Under the Hood

L.C.G. is built on four design principles that make it different from a chatbot:

| | Principle | Why it matters to you |
|---|---|---|
| 💬 | **Plain English config** | Change any behavior by editing a markdown file — no code, no IT ticket |
| 🏠 | **Local-first** | Your data never leaves your laptop |
| 🔀 | **Multi-signal** | One request cross-references email + calendar + CRM + your notes |
| 🔄 | **Self-correcting** | When you correct L.C.G., it remembers — and doesn't make the same mistake twice |

<details>
<summary><strong>Connected systems (for the curious)</strong></summary>

L.C.G. connects to your live enterprise data through a secure local bridge. One request reads from all of these at once:

| Category | Systems |
|---|---|
| 📧 **Communication** | Outlook Mail, Teams Chat, Teams Channels |
| 📅 **Scheduling** | Outlook Calendar, room booking |
| 📊 **CRM** | Microsoft Sales Experience (MSX) — opportunities, milestones, accounts |
| 📈 **Analytics** | Power BI — billed pipeline, consumption, SQL600, and more |
| 📁 **Files** | SharePoint, OneDrive, Word |
| 🗄️ **Memory** | Your local Obsidian vault |
| 🔍 **Search** | WorkIQ cross-M365 retrieval |

</details>

## Troubleshooting

### `npm ERR! 404 Not Found` or `401 Unauthorized` from `npm.pkg.github.com`

**What's happening:** Some MCP server packages (`@microsoft/msx-mcp-server`, `@jinlee794/obsidian-intelligence-layer`) are published to GitHub Packages, not the public npm registry. The project `.npmrc` already routes these scopes to the right place — but GitHub Packages requires a personal access token (PAT) for authentication, even for read-only access.

**Fix it in one step:**

```bash
npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

When prompted:

- **Username:** your GitHub username
- **Password:** a personal access token (classic) with the `read:packages` scope
- **Email:** your GitHub email

That's it. The token is saved to your user-level `~/.npmrc` and applies everywhere.

<details>
<summary>Manual alternative (if <code>npm login</code> doesn't work)</summary>

1. Go to [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click **Generate new token (classic)**
3. Select the **`read:packages`** scope
4. Copy the token
5. Open (or create) `~/.npmrc` and add this line:

```
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=ghp_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

Replace `ghp_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual token.

</details>

> **Why is this needed?** GitHub Packages doesn't support anonymous reads. The project-level `.npmrc` in this repo handles *which* packages go to GitHub vs. public npm — you just need to provide a token so GitHub lets you in.

### MCP server fails to start with `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME`

This usually means you're running a Node version older than 18. Check with `node --version` and upgrade if needed.

### `copilot CLI not found` when running automations

The task runner uses GitHub Copilot's CLI binary. It looks for it in:

1. `COPILOT_CLI_PATH` environment variable
2. `copilot` on your system PATH
3. VS Code's bundled location (`AppData/Code/User/globalStorage/github.copilot-chat/copilotCli/`)

Make sure GitHub Copilot Chat is installed in VS Code — it bundles the CLI automatically.

### Azure CLI token expired

CRM and M365 operations require an active Azure CLI session. If you see token errors:

```bash
az login
```
