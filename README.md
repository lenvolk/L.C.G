## Quick Start (5 Minutes)
Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [ ] **Microsoft corporate VPN** connected
- [ ] **Microsoft corp account** (e.g., `your-alias@microsoft.com`)
- [ ] **GitHub Copilot License** — [Get one here (Microsoft Internal)](https://aka.ms/copilot)

---

### Step 0: Run The Installer

> [!CAUTION]
> **The script creates an `L.C.G` folder in your current directory.** We recommend running from your home folder (`cd ~`). Don't run it inside system directories, shared drives, or folders with unrelated work.

#### macOS / Linux

1. Open **Terminal** (Spotlight → search "Terminal").
2. `cd` to where you want the `L.C.G` folder created (e.g., `cd ~` for your home folder).
3. Paste this and press **Enter**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JinLee794/L.C.G/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

#### Windows

1. Open **PowerShell** (Start → type "PowerShell" → click **Windows PowerShell**, not Command Prompt).
2. `cd` to where you want the `L.C.G` folder created (e.g., `cd ~` for your home folder).
3. Paste this and press **Enter**:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass -Force; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JinLee794/L.C.G/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

For non-main branch testing on Windows PowerShell 5.1, use:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass -Force
& ([ScriptBlock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JinLee794/L.C.G/<branch>/scripts/install.ps1))) -Ref <branch>
```

The installer creates `L.C.G/` in your current directory and runs the bootstrap automatically. Run it from an already-open PowerShell window so prompts and any errors remain visible.

---

### Step 1: What The Bootstrap Does

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When prompted for GitHub auth, use your **personal GitHub account** (e.g., `JohnDoe`), not your Enterprise Managed User account ending in `_microsoft`.

The bootstrap:

1. Installs **Node.js 18+** if missing.
2. Runs `npm install`.
3. Walks you through **GitHub Packages auth** and `.env` setup.
4. Registers the global **`mcaps`** command.

> [!TIP]
> Already have Node.js? Make sure it's v18+. Run `./scripts/bootstrap.sh --check` (macOS/Linux) or `./scripts/bootstrap.ps1 -Check` (Windows) for a dry prerequisite check.

### Step 2: Configure Your `.env` File

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and set your vault path:

```dotenv
OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH="/Path/To/Your/Obsidian/Vault"
```

> [!NOTE]
> `.env` is git-ignored — your paths and secrets stay local. The Obsidian Intelligence Layer MCP server uses this variable. Skip this and vault features won't work.

### Step 3: Set Up Your Obsidian Vault

L.C.G. uses an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault as its local "second brain" — plain markdown files for customer notes, meeting history, drafts, and learning corrections.

#### 3a. Create or choose a vault

If you don't have one yet: download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) → **Create new vault** → pick a name and location you'll remember.

Otherwise, note the full path to your existing vault (e.g., `/Users/you/Documents/Obsidian/My Vault`) and make sure Step 2's `.env` points to it.

#### 3b. Bootstrap the vault structure

```bash
cd ~/L.C.G && npm run vault:init
```

This copies starter templates into your vault (never overwrites existing files). Afterward your vault will contain:

| Created | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `_lcg/preferences.md` | Triage labels, display preferences |
| `_lcg/vip-list.md` | VIP senders that get priority in triage |
| `_lcg/operating-rhythm.md` | Weekly cadences (triage time, review days) |
| `_lcg/communication-style.md` | Tone guidance for drafted emails |
| `_lcg/learning-log.md` | Corrections L.C.G. remembers across sessions |
| `_lcg/templates/` | Meeting briefs, update requests, weekly summaries |
| `Daily/`, `Meetings/`, `Weekly/` | Working output folders |

> [!TIP]
> These are just markdown files — browse and edit them in Obsidian anytime.

#### 3c. Run the onboarding wizard

In VS Code → **Copilot Chat** → select **Chief of Staff** agent → type:

```
/onboarding
```

The wizard (~5 min) asks about your:

1. **Role** — GM, CSAM, Specialist, or M1 Manager
2. **Industry** — Segment you cover (scopes CRM + Power BI queries)
3. **Team** — By territory, seller list, org hierarchy, or just you
4. **Forecast targets** — Optional quota and coverage multiple
5. **VIP list** — High-priority senders
6. **Operating rhythm** — Default weekly cadences

Answers are saved to `_lcg/role.md` and related config files. Re-run `/onboarding` anytime, or edit the files directly.

> [!NOTE]
> Skipping onboarding is fine — L.C.G. uses defaults. But personalization makes every workflow sharper.

---

### Step 4: Start Using L.C.G.

Pick either path:

**VS Code (recommended for most users):**

In VS Code, open **Copilot Chat** (sidebar icon or `⌃⌘I` / `Ctrl+Alt+I`) → select the **Chief of Staff** agent → start typing.

**Terminal:**

Open any terminal and type `mcaps` to start an interactive session.

> Both interfaces are fully equivalent — same agents, skills, and MCP servers. See [Two Ways to Use L.C.G.](#two-ways-to-use-lcg) for details.

## Why L.C.G. Exists

You already know the pain:

- **Hundreds of emails** — and you're manually deciding what matters before your first coffee
- **Back-to-back meetings** — prep means hunting across 5+ tools you didn't build and don't love
- **Same deliverables, every week** — rebuilt from scratch instead of compounding
- **Institutional memory** — trapped in your head, not in a system
- **Follow-ups everywhere** — scattered across email, CRM, Teams, and sticky notes

No single tool today reads across your M365 + CRM stack, remembers *your* priorities, and still lets you own every final call. So you grind. Every. Single. Day.

L.C.G. turns GitHub Copilot into the tireless junior staffer you always wanted — one that **pre-reads, pre-researches, and pre-drafts everything** so you can focus on judgment, relationships, and the work that actually needs a human.

## How It Works (in plain English)

L.C.G. runs on three simple layers. You only ever interact with the first one.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  U["👤 YOU — type what you want in plain English"] --> L1

  subgraph L1["🧠 1. Instructions — how L.C.G. thinks"]
    direction LR
    I1["Your preferences"] --- I2["VIP list"] --- I3["Operating rhythm"] --- I4["Skills library"]
  end

  L1 --> L2

  subgraph L2["🔌 2. Live Data — what L.C.G. reads"]
    direction LR
    D1["📧 Outlook"] --- D2["📅 Calendar"] --- D3["💬 Teams"] --- D4["📊 CRM (MSX)"] --- D5["📈 Power BI"] --- D6["📁 SharePoint"]
  end

  L2 --> L3

  subgraph L3["💾 3. Second Brain — what L.C.G. remembers"]
    direction LR
    M1["Customer notes"] --- M2["Meeting history"] --- M3["Drafted emails"] --- M4["Learning log"]
  end

  style L1 fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#4cc9f0,color:#e0e0e0
  style L2 fill:#1b4332,stroke:#52b788,color:#e0e0e0
  style L3 fill:#3a0ca3,stroke:#c77dff,color:#e0e0e0
```

| Layer | What it means for you |
| --- | --- |
| **1. Instructions** | Your style, your VIPs, your priorities — written in plain markdown. Edit anytime. |
| **2. Live Data** | One request, many systems read at once. No more tab-hopping. |
| **3. Second Brain** | L.C.G. remembers your customers, deals, and corrections. **It gets smarter every week.** |

### Two Agents — One Brain, One Set of Hands

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  U["👤 YOU"] --> B

  subgraph B["🧠 Chief of Staff — the brain"]
    B1["Thinks, triages, drafts, recommends"]
  end

  B -- "delegates safely" --> H

  subgraph H["🤖 M365-Actions — the hands"]
    H1["Sends drafts, creates meetings, posts to Teams"]
  end

  style U fill:#0d1117,stroke:#58a6ff,color:#e6edf3
  style B fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#4cc9f0,stroke-width:2px,color:#e0e0e0
  style H fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#f72585,stroke-width:2px,color:#e0e0e0
```

The **brain** does all the thinking and never touches your inbox or Teams directly. The **hands** only act on scoped, approved instructions. If the brain wants to send a message, it hands off a draft — you approve before it leaves.

## You Stay in Control

Copilot grinds, but **nothing ships without you**.

| What L.C.G. does | What it won't do |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ **Drafts emails** in your voice | ❌ Never sends email without your review |
| ✅ **Prepares Teams messages** | ❌ Never posts without explicit approval |
| ✅ **Stages CRM updates** for review | ❌ Never writes to CRM silently |
| ✅ **Reads your vault** for context | ❌ Never syncs vault data to the cloud |
| ✅ **Logs every action** it takes | ❌ No surprise automation — ever |

> **Your data stays local.** Your vault lives on your machine. Your CRM credentials never leave your session. No external training. No "cloud memory." Just you and Copilot.

---

## What's Under the Hood

L.C.G. is built on four design principles that make it different from a chatbot:

| | Principle | Why it matters to you |
|---|---|---|
| 💬 | **Plain English config** | Change any behavior by editing a markdown file — no code, no IT ticket |
| 🏠 | **Local-first** | Your data never leaves your laptop |
| 🔀 | **Multi-signal** | One request cross-references email + calendar + CRM + your notes |
| 🔄 | **Self-correcting** | When you correct L.C.G., it remembers — and doesn't make the same mistake twice |

<details>
<summary><strong>Connected systems (for the curious)</strong></summary>

L.C.G. connects to your live enterprise data through a secure local bridge. One request reads from all of these at once:

| Category | Systems |
|---|---|
| 📧 **Communication** | Outlook Mail, Teams Chat, Teams Channels |
| 📅 **Scheduling** | Outlook Calendar, room booking |
| 📊 **CRM** | Microsoft Sales Experience (MSX) — opportunities, milestones, accounts |
| 📈 **Analytics** | Power BI — billed pipeline, consumption, SQL600, and more |
| 📁 **Files** | SharePoint, OneDrive, Word |
| 🗄️ **Memory** | Your local Obsidian vault |
| 🔍 **Search** | WorkIQ cross-M365 retrieval |

</details>

## Troubleshooting

### `npm ERR! 404 Not Found` or `401 Unauthorized` from `npm.pkg.github.com`

**What's happening:** Some MCP server packages (`@microsoft/msx-mcp-server`, `@jinlee794/obsidian-intelligence-layer`) are published to GitHub Packages, not the public npm registry. The project `.npmrc` already routes these scopes to the right place — but GitHub Packages requires a personal access token (PAT) for authentication, even for read-only access.

**Fix it in one step:**

```bash
npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

When prompted:

- **Username:** your GitHub username
- **Password:** a personal access token (classic) with the `read:packages` scope
- **Email:** your GitHub email

That's it. The token is saved to your user-level `~/.npmrc` and applies everywhere.

<details>
<summary>Manual alternative (if <code>npm login</code> doesn't work)</summary>

1. Go to [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click **Generate new token (classic)**
3. Select the **`read:packages`** scope
4. Copy the token
5. Open (or create) `~/.npmrc` and add this line:

```
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=ghp_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

Replace `ghp_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual token.

</details>

> **Why is this needed?** GitHub Packages doesn't support anonymous reads. The project-level `.npmrc` in this repo handles *which* packages go to GitHub vs. public npm — you just need to provide a token so GitHub lets you in.

### MCP server fails to start with `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME`

This usually means you're running a Node version older than 18. Check with `node --version` and upgrade if needed.

### `copilot CLI not found` when running automations

The task runner uses GitHub Copilot's CLI binary. It looks for it in:

1. `COPILOT_CLI_PATH` environment variable
2. `copilot` on your system PATH
3. VS Code's bundled location (`AppData/Code/User/globalStorage/github.copilot-chat/copilotCli/`)

Make sure GitHub Copilot Chat is installed in VS Code — it bundles the CLI automatically.

### Azure CLI token expired

CRM and M365 operations require an active Azure CLI session. If you see token errors:

```bash
az login
```
