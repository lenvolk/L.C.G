# SQL600 Sales Play Tagging Audit

## Purpose

**Cross-system audit that discovers opps and milestones on SQL600 HLS accounts that are missing or incorrectly tagged on `msp_salesplay`.** Combines PBI (SQL600 account list + pipeline workloads) with CRM (opportunity sales play + milestone workload lookup) to produce an actionable exception report.

Two alert classes:
1. **Mismatch** — Opp has SQL-related milestone workloads but `msp_salesplay` is not set to an expected SQL modernization play
2. **Gap** — SQL600 HLS account has zero open SQL-related opportunities (no pipeline coverage for the program)
3. **Win** — Opp commitment moved from `uncommitted` to `committed` since the previous audit snapshot

> **⚠️ Load Order:** Read **SKILL.md first** for the full flow. Sub-files are loaded on-demand:
> - [sql600-detection-rules.md](../_shared/sql600-detection-rules.md) — SQL workload patterns, expected sales play values, flagging logic (shared cross-role reference)
> - [output-template.md](output-template.md) — vault persistence format

## When to Use

- Periodic (weekly/bi-weekly) governance hygiene for SQL600 program tagging
- Pre-Connects or pre-review prep to ensure pipeline data quality
- Ad-hoc "which opps should be tagged to SQL600 but aren't?"
- After new opps are created on SQL600 accounts to verify tagging
- Gap account identification for accounts needing SQL pipeline

## Freedom Level

**Low** — Detection rules and workload patterns are exact. Narrative framing for the exception report is formulaic. Do not improvise severity tiers or sales play mappings — use [sql600-detection-rules.md](../_shared/sql600-detection-rules.md) exactly.

## Runtime Contract

| Tool | Purpose | Expected Calls |
|---|---|---|
| `powerbi-remote:ExecuteQuery` | Get SQL600 HLS account list + pipeline detail | **1–2** |
| `mcp_msx_list_opportunities` | Get CRM opp details with sales play | **1 per batch of accounts** (use `customerKeyword` batching) |
| `mcp_msx_get_milestones` | Get milestone workloads for flagged opps | **1–2** (batch via `opportunityIds`) |
| `oil:get_note_metadata` | Check vault note existence before write | 1 (if OIL available) |
| `oil:create_note` / `oil:atomic_replace` | Persist audit report to vault | 1 (if OIL available) |
| `create_file` | Fallback: write to `.copilot/docs/` when OIL is unavailable | 0–1 |

### Not Used

| Tool | Why Not |
|---|---|
| `powerbi-remote:GetSemanticModelSchema` | Schema mapped in parent skill's [schema-mapping.md](../powerbi-sql600-hls/schema-mapping.md) |
| `mcp_msx_crm_query` | Use higher-level `list_opportunities` and `get_milestones` instead |

## Configuration

| Setting | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **PBI Report ID** | `0551045d-b356-41d5-bda5-ff07ee97b4c1` | SQL 600 Performance Tracking |
| **PBI Semantic Model ID** | `c848b220-eaf2-42e0-b6d2-9633a6e39b37` | Same model as sql600-hls readout |
| **HLS Scope Filter** | `'2) Account'[SQL600 Account] = TRUE() && '2) Account'[Industry] = "Healthcare"` | Always active |
| **Vault Output Path** | `Daily/SQL600-HLS/sql600-tagging-audit-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` | See [output-template.md](output-template.md) |

## Flow

> **⚠️ DISPATCH RULE — ALWAYS DELEGATE TO `pbi-analyst`.**
> This skill requires PBI queries. If not already running inside `pbi-analyst`, immediately call `runSubagent` with `agentName: "pbi-analyst"` and pass the full user request + today's date.

### Step 0 — Determine Audit Mode

| User says | Mode | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| "full audit", "SQL600 tagging" (generic) | **Full** | All checks |
| "gap accounts", "missing SQL opps" | **Gap Only** | Only gap account detection |
| "mismatched", "wrong sales play", "tagging check" | **Mismatch Only** | Only sales play mismatch detection |
| Specific account name | **Account Drill** | Single account deep dive |

Default to **Full** if ambiguous.

### Step 1 — Get SQL600 HLS Accounts + Pipeline from PBI (1–2 PBI calls)

#### Q1 — SQL600 HLS Account List with Pipeline Summary

Get all 43 HLS accounts with their pipeline status and SQL workload flags:

```dax
EVALUATE
SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(
    '2) Account'[TPID],
    '2) Account'[TopParent],
    '2) Account'[Vertical],
    '2) Account'[FieldAreaShorter],
    FILTER('2) Account',
        '2) Account'[SQL600 Account] = TRUE()
        && '2) Account'[Industry] = "Healthcare"
    ),
    "ACR_LCM", [ACR (Last Closed Month)],
    "PipeCommitted", [Pipeline ACR (Committed excl Blocked)],
    "SQLCores", [Total SQL Cores],
    "ModOpps", [Modernization Opportunities],
    "AcctHasModPipe", IF([Accounts With Modernization Pipeline] > 0, 1, 0)
)
ORDER BY [ACR_LCM] DESC
```

#### Q2 — Pipeline Detail with Opportunity IDs and Workloads

Get opp-level pipeline detail including workload flags:

```dax
EVALUATE
SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(
    '2) Account'[TPID],
    '2) Account'[TopParent],
    '✽ Pipeline'[OpportunityID],
    '✽ Pipeline'[OpportunityName],
    '✽ Pipeline'[OpportunityLink],
    '✽ Pipeline'[SalesStageShort],
    '✽ Pipeline'[OpportunityOwner],
    '✽ Pipeline'[MilestoneWorkload],
    '✽ Pipeline'[Modernization Workload Flag],
    '✽ Pipeline'[MilestoneCommitment],
    '✽ Pipeline'[StrategicPillar],
    FILTER('2) Account',
        '2) Account'[SQL600 Account] = TRUE()
        && '2) Account'[Industry] = "Healthcare"
    ),
    "PipeACR", [Pipeline ACR (Qualified)]
)
ORDER BY '2) Account'[TopParent] ASC
```

### Step 2 — Identify SQL-Relevant Opportunities from PBI Data

From Step 1 Q2 results, filter for opportunities that have **SQL-related milestone workloads**. See [sql600-detection-rules.md](../_shared/sql600-detection-rules.md) § SQL Workload Patterns for the exact match list.

Build a list of unique `OpportunityID` values that have at least one SQL workload milestone.

### Step 3 — Cross-Reference with CRM Sales Play

For each SQL-relevant opportunity identified in Step 2, query CRM to get the current `msp_salesplay`:

- Use `mcp_msx_list_opportunities` with `opportunityIds` array for batch lookup
- Extract `msp_salesplay` formatted value for each opp

Compare each opp's `msp_salesplay` against the expected values in [sql600-detection-rules.md](../_shared/sql600-detection-rules.md) § Expected Sales Play Mapping.

### Step 4 — Detect Gap Accounts

From Step 1 Q1 results, identify SQL600 HLS accounts where:
- `ModOpps` = 0 AND `AcctHasModPipe` = 0 (no modernization pipeline at all)
- OR the account has `SQLCores` > 0 but no SQL-workload opportunities (cross-ref with Q2)

These are **gap accounts** — SQL600 members with on-prem SQL footprint but no SQL-related pipeline.

### Step 5 — Classify and Prioritize Exceptions

Apply severity tiers from [sql600-detection-rules.md](../_shared/sql600-detection-rules.md) § Severity Classification:

| Severity | Condition |
|---|---|
| 🔴 **Critical** | SQL workload opp with `msp_salesplay` = null or completely unrelated play |
| 🟡 **Warning** | SQL workload opp with adjacent but non-ideal play (e.g., "Innovate with AI" for a SQL MI modernization) |
| ⚪ **Gap** | SQL600 account with zero SQL-related opps, especially if `SQLCores` > 0 |
| ✅ **Clean** | SQL workload opp with correct expected play |

### Step 5b — Capture Wins (Uncommitted -> Committed)

Detect opportunity-level commitment transitions by comparing the current classified snapshot with the prior run:

- Input: current `classify-sql-pipeline.js` output + previous classified snapshot (`--previous`)
- Win condition: prior commitment state = `uncommitted` and current state = `committed`
- Output: account + opportunity-level win table in the audit note

If normalized inbox data is available, correlate wins with potential winwire evidence:

- Input: `normalize-mail.js` output (`--mail`)
- Signal terms: `winwire`, `win wire`, `closed won`, `deal won`
- Correlation: account/opportunity token overlap in message subject/snippet

### Step 6 — Present & Persist

1. Present the formatted exception report per [output-template.md](output-template.md)
2. **Persist — OIL-first with local fallback:**
   - **If OIL MCP server is available:** Use standard vault write sequence:
     - `oil:get_note_metadata` for `Daily/SQL600-HLS/sql600-tagging-audit-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`
     - If exists → `oil:atomic_replace` with `mtime_ms`
     - If not → `oil:create_note`
   - **If OIL MCP server is NOT available:** Write to `.copilot/docs/sql600-tagging-audit-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` via `create_file`. This keeps the report accessible in the workspace for later vault ingestion.

## Decision Logic

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Opp has multiple workloads (SQL + non-SQL) | Still flag if SQL workload is present and salesplay doesn't match |
| Opp is in "Realize Value" or completed stage | Include but mark as `(completed)` — lower severity, still important for tracking |
| Account has non-SQL opps only | Report as gap account if SQLCores > 0 |
| Sales play is "Migrate and Modernize Your Estate" | ✅ Clean for any SQL workload |
| Sales play is "Innovate with Azure AI Apps and Agents" but opp has SQL MI workload | 🟡 Warning — should likely be "Migrate and Modernize" |
| Sales play is null/empty | 🔴 Critical — must be set |
| User requests single account drill | Run full pipeline for that account only — skip gap account detection |

## Helper Script Pipeline

**Use these scripts to keep agent context lean.** PBI + CRM queries return large payloads that saturate context. The scripts do the classification and cross-referencing offline, returning only the compact exception report.

### Pipeline Flow

```
PBI Q1+Q2 → /tmp/sql600-pipeline-<DATE>.json
            ↓
classify-sql-pipeline.js → /tmp/sql600-classified-<DATE>.json
            ↓                    (compact: just SQL opps + gap accounts)
CRM batch → /tmp/sql600-crm-<DATE>.json
            ↓
audit-sales-play.js → /tmp/sql600-audit-<DATE>.json  (or --format md → vault-ready)
```

### Step-by-Step with Scripts

```bash
DATE=$(date +%F)

# 1. Save PBI results to temp file (agent writes JSON from ExecuteQuery)
#    Shape: { "accounts": [...Q1...], "pipeline": [...Q2...] }
#    → Agent saves this after PBI queries

# 2. Classify SQL workloads (Tier 1/2/3) + identify gap accounts
node scripts/helpers/classify-sql-pipeline.js /tmp/sql600-pipeline-$DATE.json \
  > /tmp/sql600-classified-$DATE.json

# 3. Agent reads classified summary (small!) and does targeted CRM lookups
#    for unique opp IDs in .summary.uniqueOppIds
#    → Agent saves CRM results to /tmp/sql600-crm-$DATE.json

# 4. Cross-reference sales plays and generate audit report
node scripts/helpers/audit-sales-play.js \
  --pipeline /tmp/sql600-classified-$DATE.json \
  --previous /tmp/sql600-classified-$PREV_DATE.json \
  --crm /tmp/sql600-crm-$DATE.json \
  --mail /tmp/mail-normalized-$DATE.json \
  --format md \
  --output /tmp/sql600-audit-$DATE.md

# 5. Agent reads compact audit output and persists:
#    - If OIL MCP available → oil:create_note / oil:atomic_replace to Daily/SQL600-HLS/
#    - If OIL MCP unavailable → create_file to .copilot/docs/
```

### What Each Script Does

| Script | Input | Output | Agent Context Saved |
|---|---|---|---|
| `classify-sql-pipeline.js` | Raw PBI JSON (~100KB+) | Classified opps + gap accounts + summary.uniqueOppIds | Reads only `summary` block (~20 lines) to know which CRM lookups to do |
| `audit-sales-play.js` | Classified JSON + CRM JSON (+ optional previous + normalized mail) | Exception report (JSON or Markdown) with wins | Reads final report (~50–100 lines) instead of raw CRM data (1MB+) |

### Agent Instructions for Script Use

1. **After PBI queries:** Write `{ "accounts": [...], "pipeline": [...] }` to `/tmp/sql600-pipeline-<DATE>.json` using `echo` or heredoc
2. **Run classifier:** Execute `classify-sql-pipeline.js` and **read only `.summary`** from the output — this gives `uniqueOppIds` for CRM lookups + gap account count
3. **CRM lookups:** Use `uniqueOppIds` to batch-fetch opportunities via `mcp_msx_list_opportunities`. Save results to `/tmp/sql600-crm-<DATE>.json`
4. **Run auditor:** Execute `audit-sales-play.js` with `--format md`. Read the markdown output and persist to vault
  - Include `--previous` to detect uncommitted -> committed wins
  - Include `--mail` to correlate wins with winwire inbox evidence
5. **Present:** Show the user the critical/warning/gap summary from the output

> **Key benefit:** PBI payloads (~130+ rows) and CRM payloads (~hundreds of opps) never enter agent context. Agent only sees the ~50-line summary + exceptions.

## Guardrails

- **Read-only** — never write to PBI or CRM from this skill. Exceptions are surfaced for human action
- **Always HLS-scoped** — never run unscoped queries
- **CRM batch size** — max 10 opportunity IDs per `list_opportunities` call
- **No auto-correction** — flag issues, never auto-update `msp_salesplay`. Stage for human review
- **Idempotent** — running twice on the same day replaces the same vault note
