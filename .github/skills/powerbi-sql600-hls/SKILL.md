# SQL600 HLS Executive Readout (Power BI)

## Purpose

**On-demand executive readout for the SQL600 HLS portfolio.** Queries the SQL 600 Performance Tracking Power BI model live to produce a concise, high-signal brief covering ACR performance, pipeline health, modernization coverage, renewal risk, week-over-week movement, and industry ranking — all scoped to the 43 Healthcare accounts in the SQL600 program.

Designed for Patty (exec consumer) to pull updates at any time and get an executive-level readout automatically. Reusable across Connects evidence, 1:1 prep, and leadership updates. Always frames progress through **Database Compete (DBC)** and competitive positioning against GCP leakage.

> **⚠️ Load Order:** Read **SKILL.md first** for the full flow. Sub-files are loaded on-demand:
> - [schema-mapping.md](schema-mapping.md) — table/column mapping, relationship model, DAX filter patterns
> - [query-rules.md](query-rules.md) — all DAX queries (aggregate + detail)
> - [output-template.md](output-template.md) — vault persistence format

## When to Use

- On-demand executive readout for SQL600 HLS portfolio
- Pre-meeting prep for DBC reviews, Connects, or leadership updates
- Monthly/weekly trend checks on HLS SQL600 ACR trajectory
- Renewal window risk assessment (FY26 Q3/Q4 critical window)
- Modernization pipeline coverage gaps and factory attach rate
- Industry ranking validation — report HLS's actual position among SQL600 industries without assuming a prior narrative
- Identifying GCP leakage risk accounts (no pipeline coverage)

## Freedom Level

**Medium** — Executive narrative requires judgment for emphasis and framing. DAX queries and output structure are exact. Trend interpretation and competitive framing use the DBC lens.

## Runtime Contract

| Tool | Purpose | Expected Calls |
|---|---|---|
| `powerbi-remote:ExecuteQuery` | All PBI data retrieval | **2–3** (snapshot + details + optional trend) |
| `oil:get_note_metadata` | Check vault note existence before write | 1 |
| `oil:create_note` / `oil:atomic_replace` | Persist readout to vault | 1 |

### Removed from Runtime

| Tool | Why Removed |
|---|---|
| `powerbi-remote:GetSemanticModelSchema` | Schema fully mapped in [schema-mapping.md](schema-mapping.md). Never call. |
| `powerbi-remote:GetReportMetadata` | Report ID hardcoded. Auth verified by first `ExecuteQuery`. |

## Configuration

| Setting | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Report ID** | `0551045d-b356-41d5-bda5-ff07ee97b4c1` | SQL 600 Performance Tracking in Business Precision |
| **Semantic Model ID** | `c848b220-eaf2-42e0-b6d2-9633a6e39b37` | SQL 600 Performance Tracking |
| **HLS Scope Filter** | `'2) Account'[SQL600 Account] = TRUE() && '2) Account'[Industry] = "Healthcare"` | Always active — hardcoded scope |
| **HLS Account Count** | 43 (of 251 total SQL600) | 17% of SQL600 portfolio |
| **Vault Output Path** | `Daily/SQL600-HLS/sql600-hls-readout-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` | See [output-template.md](output-template.md) |

### Key People

| Person | Role | Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| **Patty** | Exec consumer | Primary audience — on-demand self-serve readouts |
| **Dandy Weyn** | Business SME | Knows the right questions to shape readout content |
| **Judson** | Account list owner | Owns static SQL600 HLS account list; gets weekly alerts from Carlton |
| **Carlton** | Weekly alerts | Sends weekly SQL600 alerts to Judson |

## Flow

> **⚠️ DISPATCH RULE — ALWAYS DELEGATE TO `pbi-analyst`.**
> This skill MUST be executed by the `pbi-analyst` subagent. If not already running inside `pbi-analyst`, immediately call `runSubagent` with `agentName: "pbi-analyst"` and pass the full user request + today's date.

### Step 0 — Scope Resolution (implicit)

Scope is **always hardcoded** to SQL600 HLS:
- `'2) Account'[SQL600 Account] = TRUE()`
- `'2) Account'[Industry] = "Healthcare"`

No user disambiguation needed. If the user provides a specific account name or TPID, add it as an **additional** filter on top of HLS scope — never remove the HLS scope.

Determine which **readout mode** the user wants:

| User says | Mode | Queries to run |
|---|---|---|
| "full readout", "executive readout", "SQL600 HLS" (generic) | **Full** | All queries |
| "top accounts" | **Accounts** | Portfolio Snapshot + Top Accounts |
| "renewal watch", "renewals" | **Renewal** | Portfolio Snapshot + Renewal Exposure |
| "modernization", "mod pipeline" | **Modernization** | Portfolio Snapshot + Modernization Coverage |
| "trend", "trajectory", "month over month" | **Trend** | Portfolio Snapshot + ACR Trend + WoW Delta |
| "ranking", "industry rank" | **Ranking** | Industry Ranking |
| Specific account name/TPID | **Account Drill** | Single-account detail |

Default to **Full** if ambiguous.

### Step 1 — Combined Portfolio Snapshot + Industry Ranking (1 PBI call)

Execute 4 queries in one `ExecuteQuery` call using `daxQueries` array. See [query-rules.md](query-rules.md) § Q1–Q4.

1. **Q1 — Portfolio KPI Snapshot**: ACR (LCM), Pipeline (Committed/Uncommitted/Qualified), Qualified Opps, Total Opps, Modernization Opps, Pipeline Penetration %, SQL TAM, SQL Cores, Annualized Growth, WoW Change, Accounts With/Without Mod Pipeline, Factory Attach %
2. **Q2 — Industry Ranking**: All SQL600 industries by ACR LCM — validates HLS position
3. **Q3 — Vertical Breakdown**: Health Payor / Provider / Pharma / MedTech with account counts, ACR, committed pipeline
4. **Q4 — ACR Monthly Trend**: FY26 month-by-month ACR for HLS SQL600 — shows trajectory

If any query fails with auth error → stop, show auth recovery message.

### Step 2 — Detail Queries (1–2 PBI calls, conditional by mode)

Based on readout mode from Step 0, execute detail queries from [query-rules.md](query-rules.md) § Q5–Q9. Use `daxQueries` array to batch up to 4 per call.

| Query | Gate Condition | What It Returns |
|---|---|---|
| **Q5 — Top 15 Accounts** | Always (Full, Accounts) | TPID, TopParent, Vertical, Segment, FieldAreaShorter, ACR LCM, Pipeline, Annualized Growth |
| **Q6 — Renewal Exposure** | Full, Renewal | SQL500 Target List accounts with renewal quarters, SQL Cores, Arc status |
| **Q7 — Modernization Pipeline** | Full, Modernization | Accounts with mod pipeline, factory attach, qualified mod pipe without factory |
| **Q8 — Gap Accounts** | Full | Accounts in SQL600 HLS with zero committed pipeline (GCP leakage risk) |
| **Q9 — Top Opportunities** | Full, Account Drill | Opportunity detail with stage, owner, commitment, pipeline ACR |

### Step 3 — Synthesize Executive Readout

Assemble the data into the narrative structure defined in [output-template.md](output-template.md). Key synthesis rules:

1. **Lead with the headline number** — ACR LCM + MoM trajectory direction (↑/↓/→)
2. **Industry ranking** — State HLS's actual rank and how it compares to the SQL600 average on pipeline penetration and annualized growth. Report the position neutrally (ahead of / in line with / behind the average). Do NOT inject tone or reuse prior framings ("laggard", "correcting the narrative", "finally outperforming"). Let the numbers carry the message.
3. **Correlate supporting signals** — When a metric stands out (high/low rank, large WoW move, sharp MoM change, gap-account concentration), look across sections for 1–2 correlated data points that reinforce or complicate the picture (e.g., committed pipe vs. renewal exposure, mod pipeline coverage vs. factory attach, top-account concentration vs. gap accounts). Surface the correlation as an observation, not a causal claim.
4. **DBC framing** — Frame pipeline and modernization through Database Compete lens
4. **GCP competitive** — Call out gap accounts (no pipeline) as GCP leakage risk
5. **Renewal urgency** — Flag Q3/Q4 renewal accounts with SQL Cores and current pipeline coverage
6. **WoW delta** — Show Realized ACR + Baseline + Pipe week-over-week movement with $ and direction
7. **Top accounts** — Highlight 5–7 accounts by ACR, growth trajectory, or risk, and include a concrete recommended SQL modernization next step for each (pre-computed by `generate-next-steps.js` using GitHub Models API)
8. **AI-forward modernization insight** — Surface a portfolio-level insight connecting modernization execution to downstream AI enablement readiness (pre-computed by `generate-next-steps.js`)

### Step 4 — Present & Persist

1. Present the formatted readout to the user per [output-template.md](output-template.md)
2. Persist to vault using standard sequence:
   - `oil:get_note_metadata` → check if today's note exists
   - If exists → `oil:atomic_replace` with `mtime_ms`
   - If not → `oil:create_note`

#### HTML Dashboard Output (optional)

When the user says "html report", "dashboard", "rich report", or "exec report":

1. Collect all PBI query results into a single JSON object matching the schema below
2. Write JSON to `/tmp/sql600-data-<YYYY-MM-DD>.json`
3. Enrich with MSX `AccountId` (required for clickable deep links):
   `node scripts/helpers/enrich-sql600-accounts.js /tmp/sql600-data-<YYYY-MM-DD>.json`
4. Generate LLM-backed recommended next steps and AI-enablement outlook (parallel, uses GitHub Models API):
   `node scripts/helpers/generate-next-steps.js /tmp/sql600-data-<YYYY-MM-DD>.json`
   - Uses `gpt-4.1-mini` by default (cheap/fast). Override with `--model <name>`.
   - Runs account-level prompts in parallel (`--concurrency 8` default).
   - Adds `NextStep` to each account row and `_aiInsight.modernizationOutlook` to the JSON.
   - Use `--dry-run` to preview without API calls.
5. Run: `node scripts/helpers/generate-sql600-report.js /tmp/sql600-data-<YYYY-MM-DD>.json`
6. Output lands in `.copilot/docs/sql600-hls-readout-<YYYY-MM-DD>.html`
7. Open in browser for preview; printable to PDF via Cmd+P

**JSON input schema** for `generate-sql600-report.js`:
```json
{
  "generated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "snapshot": { "ACR_LCM": number, "ACR_YoY_Pct": "string", "AnnualizedGrowth": number, "PipeCommitted": number, "PipeUncommitted": number, "PipeQualified": number, "QualifiedOpps": number, "TotalOpps": number, "ModernizationOpps": number, "PipelinePenetration": "string", "SQLTotalTAM": number, "SQLCores": number, "AcctsWithModPipe": number, "AcctsWithoutModPipe": number, "FactoryAttach": "string", "WoW_Change": number, "AccountCount": number },
  "ranking": [{ "Industry": "string", "ACR_LCM": number, "AccountCount": number }],
  "verticals": [{ "Vertical": "string", "AccountCount": number, "ACR_LCM": number, "PipeCommitted": number, "PipeUncommitted": number, "AnnualizedGrowth": number, "ModOpps": number }],
  "trend": [{ "FiscalMonth": "YYYY-MM-DD", "FiscalQuarter": "string", "ACR": number }],
  "topAccounts": [{ "TopParent": "string", "TPID": number, "AccountId": "guid", "Vertical": "string", "Segment": "string", "ACR_LCM": number, "PipeCommitted": number|null, "PipeUncommitted": number|null, "AnnualizedGrowth": number, "QualifiedOpps": number|null, "TotalOpps": number|null, "SQLCores": number|null, "NextStep": "string (from generate-next-steps.js)" }],
  "renewals": [{ "TopParent": "string", "TPID": number, "AccountId": "guid", "Category": "string", "RenewalQuarter": "string|null", "SQLCores": number, "ArcEnabled": "Yes|No", "ACR_LCM": number|null, "PipeCommitted": number|null, "NextStep": "string (from generate-next-steps.js)" }],
  "gapAccounts": [{ "TopParent": "string", "TPID": number, "AccountId": "guid", "Vertical": "string", "ACR_LCM": number|null, "PipeUncommitted": number|null, "SQLCores": number|null, "NextStep": "string (from generate-next-steps.js)" }],
  "_aiInsight": { "modernizationOutlook": "string (from generate-next-steps.js)" }
}
```

> **`AccountId` is REQUIRED** on every account-level row in `topAccounts`, `renewals`, and `gapAccounts`. The HTML generator builds MSX deep links as `main.aspx?etn=account&id=<AccountId>&pagetype=entityrecord` — this is the only URL shape MSX reliably routes to a specific record. TPID/name-based quick-find URLs silently land on the user's "My Active Accounts" home view and are intentionally NOT emitted.
>
> PBI does not project `AccountId`. The enrichment helper [`scripts/helpers/enrich-sql600-accounts.js`](../../../scripts/helpers/enrich-sql600-accounts.js) resolves each `TopParent` → MSX top-parent account GUID via a curated map (maintained from Dynamics queries with `_parentaccountid_value eq null`). Run it before `generate-sql600-report.js`. If any row is unmapped, the helper prints it to stdout — add the new top-parent to the map before regenerating. TPID is still useful for display and must be preserved when flattening PBI results.

**Narrative override.** When a markdown readout file matching the date exists at `.copilot/docs/sql600-hls-readout-<date>.md` or `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/Daily/SQL600-HLS/sql600-hls-readout-<date>.md`, the generator auto-discovers it and extracts the blockquote narratives under each `##` section (Headline, ACR Trajectory, Vertical Breakdown, Industry Ranking, Top Accounts, Renewal Watch, Modernization, GCP Leakage) plus the Key Takeaways bullet list. These replace the hardcoded prose in the HTML. Pass `--narrative <path>` to override auto-discovery.

## Decision Logic

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| User asks for "SQL600" without "HLS" qualifier | Check if they mean all SQL600 or HLS specifically. If context suggests HLS (e.g., mentions Patty, DBC, healthcare), proceed with HLS scope. Otherwise ask. |
| ACR trend is declining MoM | Flag prominently. Include "⚠️ Declining trajectory" in headline. Check if pipeline coverage compensates. |
| HLS industry rank changes from prior readout | Report the new rank accurately and note the delta from the previous position. Do not editorialize — state the direction and let the reader interpret. |
| Specific account has zero pipeline and high SQL cores | Tag as "🔴 GCP LEAKAGE RISK" — high SQL footprint with no modernization pipeline = competitive vulnerability. |
| Renewal in current quarter with no committed pipeline | Tag as "🔴 RENEWAL AT RISK" — immediate action needed. |
| Factory attach rate is below 15% | Flag as modernization execution gap — factory resources not being leveraged. |
| WoW change is significantly negative (> $1M decline) | Flag as "⚠️ Week-over-week decline" with $ amount. |

## Output Schema

See [output-template.md](output-template.md) for full vault note format.

**Console output** (shown to user) follows the same structure but without frontmatter — just the formatted readout body.

## Guardrails

- **Read-only** — never write to PBI or CRM from this skill
- **Always HLS-scoped** — never run unscoped queries against the full SQL600 model
- **Max rows**: 50 per detail query. Top accounts capped at 15 unless user requests more
- **Dollar formatting**: Always whole numbers, $ prefix, comma separators. Use compact format ($12.8M, $454K) for KPI cards
- **Period-over-period**: Always show direction arrow (↑↓→) alongside delta values
- **DBC lens**: Frame competitive insights through Database Compete narrative, not generic Azure growth
- **Fun factor**: Occasional easter eggs in readout tone — memorable, not robotic. Keep it sharp and engaging
