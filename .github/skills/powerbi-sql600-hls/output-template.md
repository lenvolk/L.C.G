# Output Template — SQL600 HLS Executive Readout

> **Freedom Level: Low** — Use this template exactly. Do not improvise heading names, reorder sections, or omit frontmatter fields. Sections with zero results should note "None detected", not be omitted.

## Vault Path

```

Use `oil:create_note` for new notes, `oil:atomic_replace` if the note already exists for the same date.

### Field Rules

| Field | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `acr_lcm` | string | Always quoted. Compact format: `"$15.4M"`. Never raw number. |
| `acr_mom_direction` | string | Arrow based on last 2 closed months comparison. `↑` if positive, `↓` if negative, `→` if flat (< 1% change). |
| `annualized_growth` | string | Always quoted. Compact format: `"$196.3M"`. |
| `pipe_committed` | string | Always quoted. Can be negative (blocked > committed). |
| `wow_change` | string | Always quoted. Include sign: `"+$1.3B"` or `"-$450K"`. |
| `wow_direction` | string | Arrow based on `wow_change` sign. |
| `industry_rank` | int | Ordinal position by ACR LCM among all SQL600 industries. 1 = highest. |
| `gap_account_count` | int | Count of HLS SQL600 accounts with zero committed pipeline. |

## Body Template

```markdown
# SQL600 HLS Executive Readout — <Month Day, Year>

**Portfolio:** <hls_account_count> HLS accounts · <total_sql600_accounts> total SQL600
**Industry Rank:** #<rank> of <industry_count> SQL600 industries by ACR

## 🎯 Headline

**<ACR_LCM>** ACR (LCM) · <acr_mom_direction> MoM · **<annualized_growth>** annualized growth since June '25
**<wow_change>** WoW movement (<wow_direction>) · Pipeline Penetration: **<pipeline_penetration>**

> <one- or two-line DBC narrative — derive from this readout's actuals. Compare HLS's pipeline penetration and annualized growth to the SQL600 average computed in the Industry Ranking section, then state the factual position neutrally (ahead / in line with / behind). Where the comparison is notable, reinforce it with 1–2 correlated data points from elsewhere in this readout (e.g., ACR MoM/YoY direction, WoW delta, factory attach %, mod pipeline coverage, renewal exposure, gap-account count). Only cite correlations actually supported by the numbers — do not invent causation.>

## 📈 ACR Trajectory (FY26)

| Month | ACR |
|---|---|
<for each month in Q4 result:>
| <MMM yyyy> | <$formatted> |

> <trend narrative — direction, inflection points, trajectory interpretation. Where possible, correlate inflections with supporting signals from other sections (e.g., a jump in committed pipeline, a large renewal closing, mod-opps ramp, top-account expansion). Keep it factual — note the correlation, not a causal claim.>

## 🏥 Vertical Breakdown

| Vertical | Accounts | ACR (LCM) | Committed Pipe | Uncommitted Pipe | Growth | Mod Opps |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
<for each vertical:>
| <vertical> | <count> | <acr> | <committed> | <uncommitted> | <growth> | <mod_opps> |

## 🏆 Industry Ranking (SQL600)

| Rank | Industry | Accounts | ACR (LCM) | Committed Pipe |
|---|---|---|---|---|
<for each industry, sorted by ACR DESC:>
| <rank> | <industry> | <count> | <acr> | <committed> |

> <narrative — derived from the ranking table above. State HLS's rank, the gap (absolute or %) vs. the top industry and vs. the SQL600 average, and whether HLS is ahead/in line/behind. Reinforce with correlated signals where they strengthen or complicate the position (e.g., HLS pipeline penetration vs. ranking peers, committed pipe concentration, mod-opps share, factory attach). No hardcoded framing — recompute from the data each time.>

## 🔝 Top Accounts

| # | Account | TPID | Vertical | Segment | ACR (LCM) | Committed | Uncommitted | Ann. Growth |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
<for each top account:>
| <n> | <TopParent> | <TPID> | <vertical> | <segment> | <acr> | <committed> | <uncommitted> | <growth> |

## ⚠️ Renewal Watch

| Account | TPID | Category | Renewal Q | SQL Cores | Arc? | ACR (LCM) | Committed Pipe |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
<for each renewal account, renewals first then sorted by SQL Cores DESC:>
| <TopParent> | <TPID> | <category> | <renewal_q> | <cores> | <arc> | <acr> | <committed> |

> <renewal narrative — Q3/Q4 exposure, accounts needing immediate DB mod positioning>

## 🏭 Modernization Coverage

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Accounts with Mod Pipeline** | <accts_with> / <total_hls> |
| **Accounts without Mod Pipeline** | <accts_without> |
| **Modernization Opportunities** | <mod_opps> |
| **Factory Attach Rate** | <factory_attach> |

## 🔴 GCP Leakage Risk (Zero Committed Pipeline)

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
<for each gap account:>
| <TopParent> | <TPID> | <vertical> | <acr> | <uncommitted> | <cores> |

> <competitive narrative — what HLS customers aren't spending with us, they're spending with GCP. DB mod positioning directly competes with GCP capture.>
