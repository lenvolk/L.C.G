# Patty D Deal Summary Draft

Today is {{TODAY}}. Build a deal-summary draft package in Patty D style from the last {{WINDOW_DAYS}} days.

## Steps
1. Read vault context first:
  - _kate/preferences.md
  - _kate/communication-style.md
2. Pull source candidates from mail and Teams using name and alias variants:
  - Patty D
  - Patty Dilger
  - Patty Dilger-Vivian
  - Patty Carrolo
3. Include naming variants for artifacts:
  - deal summary, deal overview, commercial summary, MACC summary, win wire.
4. Keep only items with concrete commercial movement:
  - value changes, close movement, milestone shifts, escalation asks.
5. Build one concise summary card per deal.
6. Persist output via OIL to Weekly/{{TODAY}}-patty-d-deal-summary.md:
  - Call `oil:get_note_metadata` for that path.
  - If the note exists: use `oil:atomic_replace` with `mtime_ms` as `expected_mtime`.
  - If the note does not exist: use `oil:create_note`.
  - Never use `create_file`.

## Guardrails
- Draft only. Never send.
- No CRM writes.
- If direct Patty D phrasing is missing, produce best-match output and label it as inferred-source pattern.
