# Meeting Follow-Up

Capture action items and stage follow-through after {{meeting_name}} on {{meeting_date}}.

## Inputs

- meeting_name: {{meeting_name}}
- meeting_date: {{meeting_date}}
- customer_or_topic: {{customer}}
- meeting_file_slug: {{meeting_file_slug}}

## Steps

1. Read vault context first:

- _lcg/preferences.md
- _lcg/communication-style.md
- Prior note: Meetings/{{meeting_date}}-{{meeting_file_slug}}.md (if it exists)

2. Pull post-meeting context:

- Meeting invite details and attendee list.
- Relevant emails from the last 48 hours tied to the meeting topic.
- CRM milestones linked to {{customer}} (or best-match topic).

3. Extract action items with deterministic fields:

- Action
- Owner
- Due signal (date or "not specified")
- Evidence source (mail, meeting note, CRM)

4. Tag each action item:

- CRM_TASK_CANDIDATE when it should become a CRM task.
- EMAIL_FOLLOWUP_NEEDED when owner confirmation is needed.

5. Stage follow-through only (do not execute):

- Build a staged CRM task queue for review.
- Draft owner follow-up emails for unresolved items.

6. Persist follow-up record via OIL:

- Target: Meetings/{{meeting_date}}-{{meeting_file_slug}}-followup.md
- Call `oil:get_note_metadata` for that path.
- If the note exists: use `oil:atomic_replace` with `mtime_ms` as `expected_mtime`.
- If the note does not exist: use `oil:create_note`.
- Never use `create_file`.

## Guardrails

- Never send messages.
- Never execute CRM writes.
- If a source is unavailable, continue and record degraded confidence.

## Output Format

Use this exact shape:

# Meeting Follow-Up:

## Run Metadata

- Date: {{meeting_date}}
- Meeting Slug: {{meeting_file_slug}}
- Quality Bar: Action owner and due signal captured for every item
